## Features

### User Authentication:
- Register new users.
- Login with JWT token generation.

### Book Management:
- Add, update, and delete books.
- Retrieve a list of books with pagination.

### Docker Support:
- Easy setup using Docker Compose.
- Separate databases for application data and identity.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**
- **.NET SDK** (optional, for local development)

## Setup with Docker Compose
Follow these steps to set up and run the project using Docker Compose:

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GioKhvedelidze/BookManagement.git
cd BookManagement
```

### Update Environment Variables:
Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and ensure the connection strings and JWT settings are correct.
Alternatively, you can override these settings using environment variables.

### Build and Run the Containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will:
- Build the **BookManagement.API** image.
- Start two **SQL Server** containers: one for the **BookManagement database** and one for the **Identity database**.
- Run the API in a container.

### Access the API:
The API will be available at:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Register a new user |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate a user and get a JWT token |
| GET | `/api/books` | Get a list of books (paginated) |
| POST | `/api/books` | Add a new book |
| PUT | `/api/books/{id}` | Update a book by ID |
| DELETE | `/api/books/{id}` | Delete a book by ID |

## Database Schema
The API uses two separate databases:
1. **BookManagement Database** - Stores book-related data.
2. **Identity Database** - Manages user authentication data.

## Environment Variables
Configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file or Docker environment:
```env
CONNECTION_STRING=your_database_connection_string
IDENTITY_DB_CONNECTION=your_identity_database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

## Running Migrations
To apply database migrations manually:
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```
Ensure that the correct connection string is configured before running migrations.
